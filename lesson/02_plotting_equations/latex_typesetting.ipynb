    "# Typsetting equations with $\\LaTeX$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\LaTeX$ is a type-setting language that can be very useful for typing up math formulas. It can be used, with some limitations, in most Markdown environments such as the one we're using in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also the gold standard for representing math in academic writing in many disciplines, including mathematics and economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\LaTeX$ can do a lot more than just write up math: entire documents, of any kind containing just about any sort of material, can be typeset using $\\LaTeX$ and compiled into PDF and other formats using software such as TexWorks. There is a strong bias towards preparing academic papers in economics using $\\LaTeX$ mostly because it's usually much harder to make math formulas using other methods. For example, Microsoft Word formula editor is, as of this writing, amazingly unreliable and difficult to work with, in my opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will focus on the basics $\\LaTeX$ math formulas. This should be enough to get you started communicating your mathematical ideas digitally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In a markdown environment, in-line equations can be offset using single dollar-signs `$`. So, \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "the simple equation $y = x^2$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...renders as: the simple equation $y=x^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using double-dollar-signs will center the equation and put it on its own line. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, let's take another look at that equation: $$y = x^2$$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...will render as: Now, let's take another look at that equation: $$y=x^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-line equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to create a multi-line aligned formula--for example, to represent the sequential steps of a derivation. One way to do this is using the $align$ environment. Double-backslashes  `\\\\` start a new line; ampersands `&` make the point on a line which should be aligned with other lines. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} 2 y^2 + x &= 18 x^2 - 11 x + 2 \\\\\n",
    "2 y^2  &= 18 x^2 - 12 x + 2 \\\\\n",
    " y^2  &= 9 x^2 - 6 x + 1\\\\\n",
    " &= (3x - 1)^2\\end{align}$$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...renders as: $$\\begin{align} 2 y^2 + x &= 18 x^2 - 11 x + 2 \\\\\n",
    "2 y^2  &= 18 x^2 - 12 x + 2 \\\\\n",
    " y^2  &= 9 x^2 - 6 x + 1\\\\\n",
    " &= (3x - 1)^2\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You could then box your final answer using the `\\boxed` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$$\\boxed{y =  \\pm (3x - 1)}$$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...rendering as: $$\\boxed{y =  \\pm (3x - 1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subscripts, superscripts, and grouping with curly braces `{`\n",
    "\n",
    "Subscripts are denoted with `_`, superscripts with `^`. If your sub- or super-script is more than 1 character long, you should group the characters together between curly braces so the operation is applied to the entire group. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$2^{22}, x_{546}$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...renders as $2^{22}, x_{546}$. If we leave out the curly braces,\n",

    "## Fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractions can be defined with the `\\frac` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$$\\frac{1 + 2}{x}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "...renders as $$\\frac{1 + 2}{x}$$\n",

    "Fractions can be nested: $$ \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{y}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}}}{z + \\frac{\\frac{z}{a-\\frac{1}{2}}-1}{32}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summation, products, limits\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit as x increased without bound of 1 divided by x can be written as\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\lim_{x\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x} = 0$$\n",

    "## Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matrix` environment can be used to present information in a tabular format. It is directly geared towards depicting matrices. For example:\n",

    "ag + bf & cg + df\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By default elements will be centered, which is most convenient for representing ordinary numerical matrices. Add an asterisk i.e. `matrix*` or `bmatrix*` or `pmatrix*`, and you are alloed to define column alignment: `l` for left, `c` for center and `r` for right. In the column alignment definition, you can use `|` separators to specify a visible line between columns. A line between rows and be specified with the `\\hline` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix*}[l | c | r r]\\text{left} & \\text{middle} & \\text{right} &\\text{right}\\\\ \\hline\n",

    "## Using a matrix to express a piecewise function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function which takes the value 0 for values less than 0 and is linear with a positive slope $b$ after than can be written as\n",
