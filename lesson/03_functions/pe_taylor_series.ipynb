    "# Practical Exercise: Taylor Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following steps as best you can:\n",
    " 1. Write a function to calculate factorials (Yes, there are built-in options. Make your own.)\n",
    " 2. Write a function to compute a term of a Taylor series of a given degree, at a given point, for a vector of $x$ inputs. It should take another function which calculates the appropriate derivative as an input.\n",
    " 3. Pick a function to approximate up to at least the 3rd degree. Write functions to compute values of that function, and of at least its first, second, and third derivatives.\n",
    " 4. Write a function (or functions) which will combine elements from the previous steps to compute Taylor approximations of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree for your chosen function.\n",
    " 5. Plot your chosen function plus it's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order approximations for an appropriate range of input values and comment on goodness of fit."
